# screen recorder

Hello Everyone, 

I am trying to create a screen recorder with audio as well video recording, also with cross-platform capability (meaning it should be able to work on windows, linux or Mac). I still have GUI part to complete, I am also trying to improve frame rate (current frame rate: 7.65) but using mss, there seem to be a few problem. I will update soon.

Currently working on Ubuntu 19.10, does not have gui hence has to be run via python

To run the given recorder
1. Clone the repository to your given location
2. Unpack the repository
3. Open integrate_audio_video.py in the repository and run the file
4. To exit recording press 'q.'

Libraries required:
1. opencv
2. numpy
3. time
4. mss
5. pyautogui
6. Pillow
7. Tkinter
8. pyaudio
9. wave
10. subprocess
11. ffmpeg
12. portaudio

Make sure you have them all.

Good Day!!
